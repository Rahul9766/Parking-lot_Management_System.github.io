## Introduction

The Parking Lot Management System is a web application built using JavaScript. It allows users to enter and track entries in a parking lot efficiently. The system utilizes JavaScript classes to handle different responsibilities, such as creating objects to represent each entry, managing the user interface, and storing and retrieving data in the browser's local storage.

### Classes:

1. **Entry Class**: Creates objects with properties like owner, car, license plate, entry date, and exit date.

2. **UI Class**: Handles user interface tasks such as displaying entries, adding entries to a table, clearing form inputs, deleting entries, showing alerts, and validating user inputs.

3. **Store Class**: Manages browser's localStorage object with methods for getting, adding, and removing entries.

### Features:

- Search and filtering functionality for table rows.
- Real-time space availability.
- Dynamic space allocation based on demand.
- Automated enforcement of parking rules and regulations.
- Data analytics for parking usage insights.
- Efficient management of parking during special events.
- Dedicated parking spots for disabled individuals.
- Management of parking spots with EV charging stations.
- Designated areas for carpooling and bike parking.
- Integration with public transportation systems and ride-sharing services.
